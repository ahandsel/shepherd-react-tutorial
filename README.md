## Create a `.env` file

Using the [.env.example](.env.example) file as a temple, create a `.env` file that will contain your login credentials and the Kintone App's View ID.

Here is what your `.env` might look like:

```txt
SUBDOMAIN = ""
APPID = ""
APITOKEN = ""
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT DELETE THE [.env.example](.env.example) FILE!  <!-- omit in toc -->
[.env.example](.env.example) is used by env-cmd to verify that `.env` file is correctly configured.

## ü§î What is Shepherd.JS?

Shepherd is a free, open-source JavaScript library for guiding users through your App.

Shepherd.JS is similar to other popular onboarding JS libraries such as Intro.JS and React Joyride but:
* Unlike Intro.JS, Shepherd.JS is free for personal and commercial uses.
* Unlike React Joyride, Shepherd.JS is not limited to React projects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What is Kintone?

Kintone is a no-code/low-code cloud platform for teams to quickly & easily share and collaborate on their data.

You can add JavaScript, CSS, &/or HTML to enhance the front-end UI/UX of a Kintone App. This can include features such as maps, buttons, and color-coding.

Read up on how to customize and develop on the Kintone platform at [kintone.dev](https://kintone.dev/)

## Debugging - Let's Fix Those Problems üí™
