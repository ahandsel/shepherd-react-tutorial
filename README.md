## Get Started

First, let's clone the [sean-kintone/shepherd-react-tutorial](https://github.com/sean-kintone/shepherd-react-tutorial) repo!  üöÄ  
Then go inside the folder.

```shell
cd Downloads

git clone https://github.com/sean-kintone/shepherd-react-tutorial

cd shepherd-react-tutorial
```

Open the `shepherd-react-tutorial` folder in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_command-line)

```shell
code .
```

### frontend & backend folders
Inside there should be two folders: `frontend` & `backend`

1. Open a terminal per folder ~
1. From inside the folders, download the required packages with `npm install`.

|                      | Terminal 1 - Frontend  üåû                          | Terminal 2 - Backend  üåö                          |

## Create a `.env` File for Your Credentials

Using the [.env.example](.env.example) file as a temple, create a `.env` file that will contain your login credentials and the Kintone App's View ID.

Here is what your `.env` might look like:

```txt
SUBDOMAIN = ""
APPID = ""
APITOKEN = ""
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT DELETE THE [.env.example](.env.example) FILE!  <!-- omit in toc -->
[.env.example](.env.example) is used by env-cmd to verify that `.env` file is correctly configured.

## ü§î What is Shepherd.JS?

Shepherd is a free, open-source JavaScript library for guiding users through your App.

Shepherd.JS is similar to other popular onboarding JS libraries such as Intro.JS and React Joyride but:
* Unlike Intro.JS, Shepherd.JS is free for personal and commercial uses.
* Unlike React Joyride, Shepherd.JS is not limited to React projects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What is Kintone?

Kintone is a no-code/low-code cloud platform for teams to quickly & easily share and collaborate on their data.

You can add JavaScript, CSS, &/or HTML to enhance the front-end UI/UX of a Kintone App. This can include features such as maps, buttons, and color-coding.

Read up on how to customize and develop on the Kintone platform at [kintone.dev](https://kintone.dev/)

## Debugging - Let's Fix Those Problems üí™

Here is a rundown of common problems that may occur & their solutions!

### Errors related to .env

If you get one of the following error messages, then please verify your `.env` file has been correctly configured, and you have not modified the `.env.example`.

* `Failed to find .env file at default paths: [./.env,./.env.js,./.env.json]`
* `[webpack-cli] Error: Missing environment variable: KINTONE_BASE_URL`
* `[webpack-cli] Error: Missing environment variable: KINTONE_USERNAME`
* `[webpack-cli] Error: Missing environment variable: KINTONE_PASSWORD`

### `npm install` command is not working

1. Verify the Node.js & npm versions **inside** the `shepherd-react-tutorial` folder
2. Just installed Node.js? Verify you configured Node.js versions **inside** the `shepherd-react-tutorial` folder

* Mac: `nodenv local 14.5.0`
* Windows: `nvm use 14.5.0`

### "npm run upload" failed?
_@kintone/customize-uploader not working?_ Let's try the following:
